This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting: improper error handling. The `bug.sh` script uses `grep` without checking its exit status.  The `bugSolution.sh` script shows the corrected version with proper error handling. This is a crucial aspect of robust shell scripting, as failing to handle errors can lead to unexpected behavior or program crashes.  The example uses `grep`, but the principle applies to any external command.
